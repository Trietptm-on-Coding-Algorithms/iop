GoodFET42-JTAG Schematics
====================================

Description
------------
This are the schematics (.brd and .sch files) for the GoodFET42-JTAG,
a modified GoodFET42 which exposes its JTAG slave and RST/NMI pins.
This board was used for my experiments in my detailed in my interrupt-oriented 
programming paper. These files may be opened with Eagle CAD or a similar tool.

Instructions for preparing board for production
------------------------------------------------
1) Open Eagle CAD
2) Open goodspeed-gerb274x.cam in Eagle's CAM Processor
3) Run the .cam file to produce a set of Gerber files
    > You can view these files in gerbv to see the actual orders that the 
      machines will be processing to make the boards
4) Send the appropriate gerber files to the PCB manufacturer to get the boards 
   made

Bugs
-----
- The MSP430F2618 on the GoodFET42-JTAG currently cannot be properly powered
  over JTAG (USB connection required to power it during JTAG session). The 
  connections from the VCC pin to the MSP430F2618 need to be fixed.
