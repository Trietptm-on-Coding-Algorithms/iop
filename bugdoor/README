TinyOS interrupt-oriented programming bugdoor
==============================================
Samuel J. Tan <samueltan@gmail.com>

Description
------------
This patch applies the bugdoor described in my paper to TinyOS, rendering
binaries compiled for the TelosB mote vulnerable to the stack-growing exploit
that could allow privileged access to the MSP430 Bootstrap Loader.

This patch works with TinyOS 2.0 source code as of 2007-07-30 07:18:52.

Instructions for applying patch
--------------------------------
1) Copy HplMsp430Usart1P.patch into [TINYOS_FOLDER]/tos/chips/msp430/usart/
2) cd into [TINYOS_FOLDER]/tos/chips/msp430/usart/
3) Type "patch < HplMsp430Usart1P.patch" to apply the patch to 
   HplMsp430Usart1P.nc
4) cd into the appropriate [TINYOS_FOLDER]/apps/[APP_NAME] for the target
5) Type "make telosb" to compile the TinyOS app for the TelosB mote target

After executing these steps, [TINYOS_FOLDER]/apps/[APP_NAME]/build/telosb
should contain a .exe executable and .ihex file containing the IOP bugdoor
that can be flashed to into a TelosB mote.
