mspdebug IOP static analysis tools patch 
=============================================
Samuel J. Tan <samueltan@gmail.com>

Description
------------
This patch adds the brute force search ("search") and interrupt state change
analyzer ("intsc") functions described in my paper to mspdebug. These static
analyzer tools are designed specifically to work with mspdebug's sim driver.

This patch works with mspdebug-0.22 obtained from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspdebug/files/

Instructions for applying patch
--------------------------------
1) Download a mspdebug-0.22 tarball from 
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspdebug/files/
2) cd to the folder with the tarball and unpack with
   "tar xvfz mspdebug-0.22.tar.gz"
3) The current directory should now contain a folder mspdebug-0.22/
   Copy mspdebug-0.22-iop.patch into the current directory (NOT into the 
   mspdebug-0.22/ folder itself)
4) Apply the patch by typing "patch -s -p0 < mspdebug-0.22-iop.patch"
5) The mspdebug-0.22/ folder is now patched
6) cd into mspdebug-0.22/ and run "make install" as root to compile and install
   the patched mspdebug-0.22 with iop static analysis tools

Instructions for use of the mspdebug sim functions "search" and "intsc" can
be found by typing "help search" or "help intsc" while running mspdebug in
simulator (sim) mode.
